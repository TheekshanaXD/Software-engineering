# Basics

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ## **1. Introduction to Software Testing**
>
> Testing is intended to show that a program does what it is intended to do and to  discover program defects before it is put into use. Testing is aimed at ensuring that a program:
>
> 1. **Does what it is intended to do** (validation)
> 2. **Discovers program defects** before it is put into use (defect testing)
>
> Testing involves executing the software with artificial data, checking the results for errors, anomalies, or information about non-functional attributes.

> ## **2. Objectives of Software Testing**
>
> - **Demonstrate to the developer and customer that the software meets its requirements** (Validation Testing)
> - **Find situations where the software behaves incorrectly, undesirably, or does not conform to its specification** (Defect Testing)

> - **Purpose:** Show the system meets its requirements using test cases that reflect expected use.
> - **Test Case Design:** Based on normal, expected inputs.
> - **Outcome:** Demonstrates correct operation for intended scenarios.
> - **Example:** For every requirement, there should be at least one corresponding test case1.

> #### **3.2 Defect Testing**
>
> ![image-20250507091821183](./assets/image-20250507091821183.png)
>
> - **Purpose:** Expose faults or bugs using test cases that may be obscure or abnormal.
> - **Test Case Design:** Based on unusual, boundary, or invalid inputs.
> - **Outcome:** Reveals incorrect, undesirable, or unspecified behavior.
> - **Example:** Tests that cause system crashes, incorrect computations, or data corruption1.

> **Note:** There is no strict boundary between validation and defect testing. Validation testing may reveal defects, and defect testing may show the system meets requirements.

> | Verification | Are we building the product right? | accordance to specification | Reviews, inspections, static analysis  |
> | Validation   | Are we building the right product? | Meeting user/customer needs | Dynamic testing, user acceptance tests |

> - **Verification:** *Static process*; <u>checks if the software meets its stated requirements and design specifications</u>( checking that the software meets its stated  functional and non-functional requirements). Involves activities like inspections and reviews, and ==does not require code execution==.

>   >   They complement dynamic testing and offer unique benefits in defect detection and quality assurance.

>   >   1. **No Error Masking**
>   >      - Testing can obscure errors: An initial error may produce unexpected outputs, making it difficult to distinguish subsequent errors from side effects.
>   >      - Inspections avoid this by analyzing code/documentation statically, enabling simultaneous discovery of multiple defects in a single session.
>   >   2. **Cost-Effective for Incomplete Systems**
>   >      - Inspections require no test harnesses or executable code, reducing overhead for partially developed systems.
>   >      - Testing incomplete systems often demands additional infrastructure (e.g., stubs, drivers), increasing development costs.
>   >   3. **Broader Quality Assessment**
>   >      - Inspections evaluate compliance with standards, portability, maintainability, and algorithmic efficiency.
>   >      - They identify poor programming practices (e.g., inefficient algorithms, unclear documentation) that testing alone cannot address

> - **Validation:** *Dynamic process*; <u>ensures the software meets the customer's expectations and actual needs</u>, <u>going beyond the specification</u>. ==Involves executing the software and checking its behavior==. Validation is a more general process. Validation is  essential because, as I discussed in Chapter 4, statements of requirements do not  always reflect the real wishes or needs of system customers and users.

 In this chapter, I focus  on testing and testing processes. I discuss reviews and inspections in more detail in Chapter 24 (Quality  Management). 


# Traditional testing process

-  Figure 8.3 is an abstract model of the traditional testing process, as <u>used in plan driven development.</u>

# **Stages of Testing**

Typically, a commercial software system has to go through three stages of testing

1. **Development Testing**

   - Conducted by developers during system creation.
   - Includes unit, component, and system testing.
   - Primarily focuses on defect testing.

2. **Release Testing**

   - Performed by a separate team before the system is released.
   - Aims to validate the system against requirements of the system stakeholders.
   - Often uses black-box (functional) testing.

3. **User Testing**

   - Conducted by actual <u>users in their environment</u>.

   - Includes alpha, beta, and acceptance testing.

   - Essential for uncovering issues not found in controlled environments.

# 8.1. Development testing

-  Development testing includes all testing activities that are carried out by the team developing the system. The tester of the software is usually the programmer who  developed that software. 

- Some development processes use programmer/tester pairs  where each programmer has an associated tester who  develops tests and assists with the testing process. 

- For critical systems, a more formal process may be used, with a separate testing group within the development team.  This group is responsible for developing tests and maintaining detailed records of  test results.

## Stages of dev testing

> **1. Unit Testing**
>
> - **Focus:** Testing individual units (methods, classes) in isolation.
>
> - **Example:**
>
>   - *Function:* A method calculating the sum of two numbers.
>
>   ```python
>   def add(a, b):  
>       return a + b  
>   ```
>
>   - *Test Cases:*
>     - `add(2, 3)` → 5 (valid input).
>     - `add(-1, 5)` → 4 (negative numbers).
>     - `add(0, 0)` → 0 (edge case).
>
> **2. Component Testing**
>
> - **Focus:** where several individual units are integrated to create composite components. Component testing should <u>focus on testing the component  interfaces</u> that provide access to the component functions.
> - **Example:**
>   - *Component:* User login module combining input validation and database checks.
>   - *Test Cases:*
>     - Valid username/password → Success message.
>     - Invalid password → Error message.
>     - Empty input → Prompt to fill fields.
>   - *Interface Check:* Ensure the validator correctly passes data to the database component.
>
> **3. System Testing**
>
> - **Focus:** where some or all of the components in a system are integrated  and the system is tested as a whole. System testing should focus on testing com ponent interactions.
> - **Example:**
>   - *System:* E-commerce checkout process.
>   - *Test Scenario:*
>     1. User adds items to cart.
>     2. Enters payment details.
>     3. Completes purchase.
>   - *Check:* Inventory updates, payment confirmation email sent, order history updated.
